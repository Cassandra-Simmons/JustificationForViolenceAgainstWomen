## Observations
- People in rural areas are more likely to justify violence against women
- People under the age of 24 are more likely to justify violence against women
- The lower the level of education a person has, the more likely they are to justify violence against women
- People 'employed for kind' are more likely to justify violence against women
- Almost half the people surveyed in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Morocco, Eritrea and Timor-Leste find at least one reason to justify violence against women
- From 2000-2005 There was no difference between the % of males and female who justified violence against women
- From 2005-2009 Males were more likely to justify violence against women than women were.
- From 2009 onwards women were more likely to justify violence against women

## Conclusions
- It's highly unlikely that for the 5 years the survey was conducted that both males and females gave exactly the same responses. Possible answers to this phenomenon may be that women might have been surveyed with men in the room, or if they were surveyed via letter or the internet, that a male family member filled out the survey instead. Investigation should be done into the surveying techniques employed for the first 5 years and how they differed starting in 2006.
- Surprisingly, women appear more likely to justify violence against themselves than their male counterparts. In not one category (overall) did the male group score higher than the females. Could this be due to the brainwashing of females from a young age to accept their lot, to an extent that exceeds what even the males themselves deem necessary
- Another interesting finding was that within married couples, the males were less likely to justify violence against women, but the women were far more liekly to justify it than their single, divorced or widowed counterparts.
- Not surprising is that those who live in urban areas and have a higher education were LESS likely to justify violence against women.
- Though the percentage of populations that justified violence against women had dropped to almost half of what it was in ~2002, we see an unpresedented spike in population that now agrees with it in the last few years (specifically in women) to the extent that the latest statistics show that the % of the population that agree with violence against women has now reached an all time high, exceeding that of 2002.
